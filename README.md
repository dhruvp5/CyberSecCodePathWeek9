# CyberSecCodePathWeek9

Time spent: *8* hours spent in total

> Objective: Setup a honeypot and intercept some attempted attacks in the wild.

* Which Honeypot(s) you deployed:

  Dionaea over HTTP

* Any issues you encountered:

  I had problems with installing and getting the Honeypot set up.  The instructions were not very clear and took a while to     get the system up and running. I had issues downloading the Google SDK and I had reinstall it and use the google shell, which I think made everything work. After figuring out how to install, everything was smooth sailing. 

* A summary of the data collected: number of attacks, number of malware samples, etc:

  I collected 2435 attacks on my honeypot. I left it on for a day.

* Any unresolved questions raised by the data collected:

  Why do people from several countries have access to something I just created. How are they gaining the IP or what are they trying to get from my honeypot.
